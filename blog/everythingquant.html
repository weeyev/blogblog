          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            This is a brief overview for anyone who has just heard of quantum
            computing and can't figure out where to start it. It's overwhelming
            at first but I think this should be a good start to start tinkering
            around on your own. A number of other resources that I found
            personally helpful will be linked in the end.

          <h2>Quantum Computing and Qiskit</h2>
          <p>
            Examples are the best way to learn anything so instead of the usual
            theory, lets keep this blog going based upon an example.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Superposition</h2>
          <p>
            Gates- Just like in boolean logic, gates take an input and then
            perform certain operations to it to eventually return the output.
            Similarly, the quantum gates are used to perform operations like
            superposition, entanglement on the qubits.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the perspective of our example, it is like putting the coin
            through a magic machine that gives it some magical powers. to make
            it start spinning, now for an observer it is quite blurry to
            determine which side is heads or tails at a given time instant. This
            is referred as a superposition of states (in our case heads and
            tails), now extending the same concept to a personal computer that
            you are using to read this. A usual 8gb ram is ~ equivalent to 64
            billion bits- where each bit stores the encoding data in 0's and
            1's, now at best the current quantum computers have around 1000
            qubits where each qubit can encode the data in a state of both 0's
            and 1's at a given time like the case of the spinning coin, now
            according to the common miconception that this makes it faster in
            performance in general- it doesn't, but yes in certain use cases
            this tremendously increases the computation power.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mathematically, a single state is represented by the dirac notation
            of bra and ket.
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>∣0⟩=( 
1
0
​
 ),∣1⟩=( 
0
1
​
 )</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>A superposed state of both of them is written by:</p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>∣ψ⟩=α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            A physical representation to distinguish between the two of them can
            be through the bloch sphere diagram. The same state can also be
            expressed as:
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>∣ψ⟩=cos(θ/2)∣0⟩+e 
iϕ
 sin(θ/2)∣1⟩</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            Where theta is the angle from z axis and psi is from x axis in the
            x-y plane. To visualise a few states: |0> and |1> lie on the north
            and south pole of the sphere respectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            The real power of computation with qubits comes when there are
            several of them- for example, imagine 2 qubits with their 4 basis
            states (00,01,10,11), 3 qubits with their eight states
            (000,001,010,100,011,110,101,111), n qubits with 2^n basis states.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
            bit and qubit difference
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Entanglement</h2>
          <p>
            Lets continue our example of the spinning coin but this time instead
            of a single coin we have two of them in the same motion, now after
            some time the coins will eventually come to rest and reveal the real
            values. In a normal scenario theres always a chance that both the
            coins will have the same observed value((HH or TT), but in our case
            if the coins are entangled with each other (connnected to each other
            by imagine a string) the outcome of one influences the other. Hence
            if coin A lands Heads then the coin B has to land Tails.
          </p>

          <p>
            This helps in creating a superposition of multiple states - i.e,
            previously only the states 0 and 1 were superposed, now we can also
            superpose their basis states- 00 and 11 to get a measurement on the
            idea of both of them, in more complex and practical use cases this
            is what is done.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Qiskit</h2>
          <p>
            Qiskit is a modern framework to implement the quantum computing
            principles in practice, developed by IBM in 2017.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gates- Just like in boolean logic, gates take an input and then
            perform certain operations to it to eventually return the output.
            Similarly, the quantum gates are used to perform operations like
            superposition, entanglement on the qubits.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the perspective of our example, it is like putting the coin
            through a magic machine that enriches it with some magical powers.
          </p>

          <p>The starter code for all these test demos remains same as:</p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>!pip install qiskit
!pip install numpy
!pip install qiskit_aer

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from numpy import pi
from qiskit_aer import Aer</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>Few most commonly used gates are:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>1) H (Hadamard Gate)</strong> - Used to superpose a given
            state into the superposed basis states.
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>qc=QuantumCircuit(2,2) # 2 qubits and 2 classical bits to store their information
qc.h(0) #puts qubit 0 into superposition
qc.draw()</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">superposed</p>

          <p>
            <strong>2) X (Not Gate)</strong>- Flips the given state to its
            conjugate (eg <0| to |1>).
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>qc=QuantumCircuit(2,2)
qc.x(0) #flips it from 0 to 1
qc.draw()</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">not</p>

          <p>
            <strong>3) CX (Controlled Not Gate)</strong>- Takes in 2 states as
            input, where one is the control gate, the other is the target. It
            maintains the state of the control qubit and flips the state of the
            target qubit.
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>qc=QuantumCircuit(2,2)
qc.cx(1,0) # where 0 is the target bit and 1 is the control bit
qc.draw()</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>4) RY (Rotational along Y axis gate)</strong>- Rotates the
            angle of a qubit by an angle theta along the y axis.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>5) CRY(Controlled Rotation along Y axis gate)</strong>-
            Applies the rotation along y axis on the target qubit only if the
            control qubit has state |1>.
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>qc=QuantumCircuit(2,2)
qc.cx(pi/2,0,1 #(angle, control, target)
qc.draw()</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">Blog image</p>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>NOTE</strong> - The Bell State is a special type that
            superposes and entangles a basis state at the same time, two most
            often used examples are: <br /><br />
            ∣Ψ <sup>+</sup> ⟩= <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>√2</sub> (∣01⟩+∣10⟩)
            <br />
            ∣Ψ <sup>−</sup> ⟩= <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>√2</sub> (∣01⟩−∣10⟩)
          </div>

          <p>
            Now lets summarize all these up together to get a basic circuit
            diagram.
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>!pip install qiskit
!pip install numpy
!pip install qiskit_aer
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from numpy import pi
from qiskit_aer import Aer
qc=QuantumCircuit(2,2) #defining a quantum circuit
qc.h(0) #puts the qubit 0 into its superposed states
qc.cx(0,1) #entangles both qubits, with 0 as control and 1 as target
#^^^ initiates a bell state of psi+ ^^^
qc.ry(pi/4,0) #rotate qubit 0 by 45 degree
qc.cry(pi/2,1,0) #rotate qubit 0 by 90 degree only if qubit 1 in state 1
qc.draw()</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>The final circuit output is:</p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">output</p>

          <p>
            Now, after we put a coin in superposition/ entangle it's state,
            finally we have to stop it from spinning for determining what
            actually is the state. This is also called as measuring the circuit.
          </p>

          <p>
            To get the measurements after collapsing a circuit, we either use
            the simulator or run it on an actual IBM computer. Practically it is
            very cost-effective and time-consuming to work on a real quantum
            computer, and almost every time people use simulators to test/run
            their projects. We will also use a qasm simulator for this project
            to simulate the measurements; there are other simulators also for
            different purposes. An example of simulator usage in our program
            above is:
          </p>

          <div class="brainfuck-code">
            <pre><code>qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])  
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
final=transpile(qc, simulator)
job = simulator.run(final, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print(counts)</code></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            Output: {'11': 71, '01': 77, '10': 404, '00': 472} -> represents the
            count of each basis state out of 1024, clearly showing how 00 comes
            in more times during measurement.

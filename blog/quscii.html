        <p>
          First things first, check out the project:
          <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog is an explanation/ guide to the same, I will not spend a lot
          of time on the truistic parts of qubits, and quantum computing.
          However, if this is your first time hearing those terms, it is
          probably a good idea watch the great video by 3b1b
          <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> or if you're
          feeling too adventurous you can refer to something that I wrote while
          explaining myself( it might not be that accurate though and if you
          have some more time refer to the 3b1b video).
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as fun facts, I will mention some differences in the classical
          approaches vs. the quantum approach here :
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The usual ascii generators map the pixel values directly from the
            1-d space, giving the same output for each pixel every time, while
            when the characters are mapped here from the Hilbert Space of
            dimensions 2^n -> n = number of qubits, on every run, they are
            different, giving it a unique form.
          </li>
          <li>
            The complexity of classical versions is O(n), whereas for the
            quantum ones, it is O(2^n), for this project, we will be working
            only with 2 qubits, making it feasible for outputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The randomness effect scales drastically after the threshold value
            of around 0.4, a comparison to realise this is below, also a graph
            visualisation would have been better but I couldn't find a good way
            to do that.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Alright, that's a lot of throat clearing for a while, let's jump into
          the implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole project is essentially using 3 major libraries: qiskit-> for
          everything quantum, pillow -> for everything image related and
          FastAPI-> for the hosting.
        </p>

          <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br />
          1) The site might take some time to get working- bear with me on
          this.<br />
          2) The regular computation time takes ~ 2-3 minutes, so have some
          patience, if it still does not work, try with a different image or dm
          me on x dot com<br />
          3) This is a fun project and by no standards is for production, be
          ready to get some bugs along the way.
        </div>

        <section>
          <h2>Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            The architecture mainly comprises of 3 subparts: Input Processing,
            Encoding, and Transformation Block.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0">
            <img
              src="/assets/imgs/img1.webp"
              alt="Architecture Diagram"
              style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Let's look at each part separately now and try to give a code demo
            for the same.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Input Processing</h2>
          <p>
            The different features like height,width, r,g,b values are extracted
            from the input image after we resize it for generality across all
            inputs. For all practical purposes, instead of processing the image
            pixel by pixel, we instead split it in into rows and columns of
            block sizes which helps in faster processing of images by reducing
            the dimensions of the input image.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's consider an example image of dimensions 16x16 pixels, and we
            define the block size as 4, making the total number of blocks in the
            image 16, with each block having the dimension of 4x4. Now, instead
            of iterating over each pixel in the image, we will be iterating over
            these blocks, thus significantly improving the computation time and
            maintaining consistency in the output.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0">
            <img
              src="/assets/imgs/img3.webp"

              style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            This is a standard process, and it helps us in our approach as
            instead of making 256 total different circuits every time, we can
            make do with only 16, hence making the whole process faster by a
            factor of (block_size)^2.

          <h2>Encoding</h2>
          <p>
            After the necessary classical information about the r,g,b values are
            fetched, we now convert and merge them into a single brightness
            value referred to as perceived brightness- done to increase
            perception for human eyes as it's a common fact that eyes are more
            sensitive to colors in the order green>red>blue. I came across this
            article a while back on the same topic and found it pretty
            interesting. This also helps in smooth mapping of characters and
            ensuring that there aren't any variations in the outputs- all the
            pixels of brightness, suppose 150, should only be mapped to a
            specific character like "/". The formula for perceived brightness
            is:
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5rem 0">
            B<sub>perceived</sub> = 0.2126â‹…R + 0.7152â‹…G + 0.0722â‹…B
          </p>

          <p>
            The encoding is done by defining a quantum circuit of 2 qubits and
            mapping the brightness values linearly into rotation angles of the
            state vector. The range of values (0,255) is mapped to (0 to Ï€/2),
            with 0 representing black and 255 being white.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0">
            <img
              src="/assets/imgs/img4.webp"
              alt="Quantum Circuit Encoding"
              style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            The conversion is executed by using the rotation along the y-axis
            gate on both qubits 0 and 1. The value of rotation is calculated in
            radians by:
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5rem 0">
            Î¸ = (val / 255) â‹… Ï€/2
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we are ready to manipulate these state vectors and rotate them
            to induce quantumness.

        <section>
          <h2>Transformation</h2>
          <p>
            The quantum effect is controlled by the magnitude; at zero it's your
            normal ascii generator, subtle effects start showing after ~0.3-0.4.
            At any value greater than 0, we first put the qubits in
            superposition with the hadamard gate and eventually use the
            controlled rotation gate for changing the values of theta in each
            pixel. For nuanced effects, the angle limit that we assume is Ï€/4
            instead of Ï€/2. This is simulated for a single shot right now, as
            the execution time increases rapidly with the usual 1024 shots
            (~1024 times increase).
          </p>

          <p>
            After conversion, we get the counts for each state -> convert them
            to integers from binary and normalize them to values between 0-255,
            giving us the processed brightness. To preserve the originalness of
            the image while adding these quantum effects, LERP - Linear
            Interpolation is used, it smoothly blends both the values with a
            weighted average on the basis of magnitude value while processing.
            The difference between using LERP and normal averaging lies in the
            flexibility that LERP inherently has, unlike hard-setting a value,
            it dynamically varies based on the magnitudes. This is how it looks
            in our use case:
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 1.5rem 0">
            blended = âŒŠvalâ‹…(1âˆ’magnitude) + qbrightâ‹…magnitudeâŒ‹
          </p>

          <p>
            The mapping is performed on the blended brightness by fetching the
            specific characters for each processed pixel block from the
            character set.

          <h2>Deployment</h2>
          <p>
            I hate this part, it's just so much intensive. FastAPI is the go to
            for deploying any python project, but the real problems came with
            it, scaling it for multiple users as render kept blocking concurrent
            requests. Initially I got into redis but had some issues, and then
            down the line decided to settle with the inbuilt backgroundtasks- it
            works fine enough and I have no intentions of investing more time
            into scaling something which is a fun proejct at the end of the day.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had a lot of fun making this, learnt a lot about both the things
            -the ones that I thought I knew about and those that I didn't,
            whenever I get back to this, would love to do this with videos
            though the feasibility is still questionable.
